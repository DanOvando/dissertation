# Introduction {#intro}

My research uses modern data science tools to integrate economics and fisheries science to improve the management of natural marine resources. The research in this dissertation presents three broadly different projects all related by this common thread. Each of these chapters mixes data and theories of human economic behavior with fisheries science though quantitative methods, including machine learning and Bayesian inference, to demonstrate how integration of human behavior can (or cannot) help us understand and manage fisheries. 

My first chapter asks, can we use fine-scale data on fishing effort to gain understanding of the abundance of fishes in space and time? To accomplish this, we pair novel data provided by Global Fishing Watch [described in @Kroodsma2018] detailing the date, location, and nature of fishing effort of (mostly) large-scale fishing opperations all around the globe, with data from fishery independent research surveys to determine if these effort data can predict fish abundance. We find that while effort data can be used to predict fish abundance, environmental data such as water temperature can do the same thing better, and that models fitted to one location are not easily exportable to a new location.

The second chapter turns to the use of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in providing conservation and fishery benefits. MPAs have a long history in marine resource management, and increasingly are looked to to provide benefits not only inside their borders but also to the waters surrounding them. There is a large amount of general theory addressing the question of when and how much we should expect MPAs to provide regional-scale conservation and fishery benefits, along with a broad literature of modeling designed to test a few theories at a time or support planning in a specific place. We created a simulation tool that integrates across the critical components of this literature to provide a new and comprehensive view of the expected regional-scale conservation and fishery impacts of MPAs. Our results demonstrate that even while controlling for critical drivers such as the size of the MPA network and the pre-MPA depletion of the fishery, the region-wide effects of MPAs are highly variable, and in many cases relatively small. We show that human behavior is one of the most critical drivers of the expected regional effects of MPAs. This has important implications for MPA monitoring programs. To demonstrate this, we pair the simulation analysis with an empirical assessment of the regional effects of a network of MPAs placed in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in 2003. Our results both present a strategy for estimating regional effects of MPAs in the real world, and match closely with the expectations generated by our simulation analysis.

The third and final chapter integrates economic theory and data into the fisheries stock assessment process. Stock assessments are statistical models that estimate critical population parameters such as fishing mortality rates using data such as catch-per-unit-effort and/or the distribution of fish lengths observed in samples from fishery catches. We demonstrate how using economic data and theory such as open-access dynamics along with data on profit per unit effort, prices, cost, labor, and technology, can improve the ability of stock assessment models to provide accurate estimates of fishing mortality rates in a data-limited context. We also present a simulation testing tool for examining model performance and helping users decide which model to use under what circumstances. Our results both open a new field of data for stock assessment and improve the ability of local stakeholders to include their historic knowledge of a fishery's economic development into the assessment process.

This dissertation makes use of a number of computing packages without which the results would be much poorer and much delayed. All analyses were based in the R programming language [@RCoreTeam2018]. However, while data processing and plotting were in done in R, this dissertation also depends on Stan [@Carpenter2017], interfaced with using the `rstan`, `rstanarm`, and `brms` packages, for Bayesian inference, along with Template Model Builder for maximum likelihood estimation [TMB, @Kristensen2016]. Code throughout the project makes extensive use of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages which made life exponentially easier (thank you `dplyr` and `ggplot2`!), and the `caret` package [@Kuhn2008] as an interface for machine learning tools. This dissertation was written in `bookdown`, adapted to match the UC Santa Barbara dissertation template through my package [`gauchodown`](https://github.com/DanOvando/gauchodown), which was made possible by numerous contributors but in particular the original work of [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) and [`huskydown`](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown). The appearance of all plots are based on the excellent "opinionated" themes presented in [`hrbrthemes`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes).
