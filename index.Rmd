abstract: "People around the world depend on the ocean for their livelihoods and cultural identity. Properly done, marine resource management can help communities balance their extractive needs with the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems. But, limited data and understanding often inhibits our ability to effectively manage our interactions with the sea, threatening both food security and ecological integrity. My research uses simulation modeling and quantitative methods to demonstrate how integrating data and theories of human behavior with ecological information can improve our understanding and management of marine ecosystems. For my first project, I ask whether we can use satellite data on the behavior of fishermen to predict the abundance of fish, and find that the answer is “sometimes, but…”. My next line of research shows that the region-wide conservation and fishery effects of Marine Protected Areas may be smaller, more variable, and harder to detect than we thought, and demonstrate an empirical approach for estimating these regional MPA effects in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Lastly, I present a novel approach for using local historic economic information, together with biological data, to improve the ability of communities to estimate the health of their fishery."
acknowledgments: "Funding for this work (for which the author is extremely grateful) was provided by the Daniel and Dianne Vapnek Fisheries Management Fellowship, and the National Marine Fisheries Service Sea Grant Population and Ecosystem Dynamics Fellowship. Along with my dissertation committee, these projects benefited from specific support by my Sea Grant advisor Dr. Jason Cope, Dr. Jenn Caselle, Dr. Merril Rudd, Dr. Jim Thorson, Dr. Cody Szuwalski, Dr. Darcy Bradley, Owen Liu, and Juan Mayorga. Huge thanks to the community at the Sustainable Fisheries Group for their support and help over the years."
dedication: "To my family for their unwavering and enthusiastic support of an unconventional career, and to Dave Tanner, for teaching me the fun of chasing your limits"
